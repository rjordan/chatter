This is a spike. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
Had this been an acutal project, it would have tests, better documentation...

This spike is to test:
http://code.google.com/p/jquery-graceful-websocket/
https://github.com/igrigorik/em-websocket
https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp

A disconnected websocket/AMQP chat client.
