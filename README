This is a spike. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
Had this been an acutal project, it would have tests, better documentation...

This spike is to test:
http://code.google.com/p/jquery-graceful-websocket/
https://github.com/igrigorik/em-websocket
https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp

A disconnected websocket/AMQP chat client.

Lesson learned: AMQP does fanouts to queues not clients. If a fanout
appears to be working like direct and shuffling messages, its because
two or more clients are sharing a queue. I used rand(10000) in this
spike to fix the issue, in real use a unique key value would be more
appropriate.
